Code for : Razmi & Nassar (2020). "Adaptive learning through temporal dynamics of state representation."

All scripts are written in Matlab and were run by Matlab R2018a.

The main analysis codes are in:  

 - changePointConditionMain

 - oddBallConditionMain
                                 
Running the changePointConditionMain script will require downloading the behavioral dataset "McGuireNassar2014data" from Nassar lab website : https://sites.brown.edu/mattlab/resources/
